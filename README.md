# CSS color Maker
![Color Marker](colormarker.png)
This code represents a simple example of colored markers created using HTML and CSS. The markers are displayed as rectangular shapes with a cap and a sleeve. Each marker has a different color scheme achieved through CSS gradients and box shadows.

The markers are contained within a <div> element with the class "container".
The CSS classes "red", "green", and "blue" define the styles for the markers with different color schemes.
The marker consists of a cap (represented by the <div> element with the class "cap") and a sleeve (represented by the <div> element with the class "sleeve").
The colors for the markers are defined using linear gradients.
The box-shadow property is used to add a shadow effect to the markers.
To see the colored markers in action, you can view the live example on CodePen.

For more information about CSS gradients and box shadows, you can refer to the MDN web docs and box-shadow documentation.
